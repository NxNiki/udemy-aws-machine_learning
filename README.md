### How to run a local Jupyter Notebook on sagemaker studio:

1. login to Amazon SageMaker AI and create a notebook instance (wait till the instance is in service)
2. start jupyterLab
3. Upload Jupyter Notebook using the `up arrow` button in jupyterLab.

amazon sagemaker example: https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples

### AutoGluon:

An easy way to compare performance of different ML models:

### lambda function:

- Lambda is Amazonâ€™s serverless compute service, which is ideal for small tasks that are frequently repeated.

- A lambda function is executed when a playload is delivered to it. A payload is a JSON object which the Lambda function can read from as an input parameter.

- lambda_handler function can return a response, as long as it can be formatted as a JSON object (dict and list).

- With Lambda, as tasks are distributed redundantly across multiple machines.


#### triger a lambda function synchronously and asynchronously.

- use aws CLI:
```
aws lambda invoke --function-name preprocess-helloblze --payload '{"s3-dataset-uri": "udacity-sagemaker-solutiondata2021/l3e1/reviews_Musical_Instruments_5.json.zip"}' response.json
```
- S3 trigger


### step functions:

- task
- state machine: a workflow (an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity)
- function orchestration
- branching

> step functions can be expensive to run (> 100x lambda invocations), so it suitable for complex workflow that is not highly frequently used.
